# Communicating with Students

Canvas has four ways faculty can communicate with students:

* Announcements 
* Inbox 
* Discussions 
* Grading/Feedback

#### Announcements

Announcements can serve various purposes. You should use them to post information that you feel all students should be immediately notified. What this information is can be up to you, and you can use it to enhance your instructor presence.

Announcements can be used to:

* welcome students each week 
* provide wrap-up thoughts after an assignment or week 
* share important information about an assignment, current events or articles that are relevant to the course

You can access the announcements for a course by clicking the “Announcements” link in the left-hand navigation.

{% tab title="Inbox" %}
#### Inbox

This in the internal message system within Canvas similar to an e-mail account. It allows to you quickly and efficient send someone or a group of people a message without having to search for their email address.

The Canvas Inbox has a built-in address book. The Inbox system works very similarly to gmail or another comparable e-mail service.

{% endtab %}

{% tab title="Discussions" %}
#### Discussions

This is another means of communicating with students. Discussions allow you to guide students, helping them to make connections between ideas and each other. They also give you a sense of how students are thinking about the topics in the course.

Engaging in discussions is an art. The goal is to encourage productive dialogue; you don’t want to dominate the discussions, but at the same time students will notice if there’s an absence of the course teaching team completely.

{% tab title="Grading/Feedback" %}
#### Grading/Feedback

The final means of communicating with students is through grading and feedback. Feedback especially helps students keep track of their progression through the course and a sense of how they are doing. Through the Gradebook, Canvas has many options for providing feedback:

* Overall assignment comment 
* Document markup so you can provide specific comments to sections/sentences/words \(this works very similarly to the Word markup tools\) 
* Audio or video feedback, with or without text comments
