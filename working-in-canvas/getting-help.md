Select the option to **contact Canvas directly by phone \(support hotline\)** or **live chat**. Both students and instructors have access to Canvasâ€™ **24/7 support services**. If you know what problem you are trying to solve, you may [search the Canvas Instructor Guides](https://community.canvaslms.com/docs/DOC-10460), which are illustrated tutorials of common instructor how-tos about Canvas features.
