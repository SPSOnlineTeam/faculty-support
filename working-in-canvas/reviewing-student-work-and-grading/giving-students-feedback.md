# Giving Students Feedback

Giving feedback to students can be done in three ways. 

They are:

1. Feedback from assignment comments 
2. Filling in a grade through the gradebook 
3. Annotating a document directly

{% tab title="1. Feedback from Assignment Comments" %}
To provide feedback through assignment comments, simply put your comments in the assignment comments field in SpeedGrader. This is located on the right-hand side of the screen. 

Once you have done so, a notification will be sent to the student. Students can respond to your comments as well. Please note you can also offer comments via audio or video file.

TIP: ****Most instructors primarily provide feedback to students using this “Assignment Comments” method.

You can also just type in a grade  \(letter, number, complete/incomplete is set in the Assignment\) via the grade book, and provide comments as well. Simply click on the small comment icon in the upper right-hand corner of each assignment block.

Another feature in Canvas allows you to comment directly in the assignment as it appears SpeedGrader. Please note that no notifications will be sent to students. You may want to add a line such as ‘see my annotations’ in assignment comments comment form as well.
