# Recording & Uploading Media with Canvas Media Recorder

Use the Canvas Media Recorder to share video or audio comments with your students \(ideally under 6 minutes\), using the microphone and webcam on your computer.  

You can create Canvas Media Recordings in Announcements, Assignments, Discussions, Pages, Quizzes, and Speedgrader. If you want to record and upload longer videos \(over 6 minutes\) we recommend you talk to one of our instructional designers.
