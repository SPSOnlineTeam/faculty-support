# Share Files, Photos, or Video URLs in Canvas

Naturally, virtual classrooms make it simple to share digital artifacts or examples; such as, .pdf, .xls, .doc, images \(.png, .jpg\), videos, or even links to websites. Authentic materials enhance your content and help your students learn; the content comes alive when you show how it’s applied in the “real world”.

{% hint style="info" %}
IMPORTANT: The steps outlined are tailored to each scenario, however the processes for linking to websites, uploading, and/or sharing images, videos, or text-based files are same whether in Canvas discussions, wiki pages, assignments, or announcements.

### Scenario 1: Add a video link to your Discussion Reply

It’s 5pm on a Tuesday and you are sitting at your desk with a cup of tea to review what’s happening in the course’s online discussion. Students have responded critically to the discussion prompt but you want to share a different perspective from a video you came across on YouTube. You hope the video will shed light on diverse perspectives. This video will open up a new conversation path. You open a new tab to search for the YouTube video link.

### **How do you link to a YouTube video in a discussion reply?**

1. Copy and paste the Share YouTube link. \(You will need it for \#3\) 
2. From the discussion, click reply to the initial post or to a thread of posts. This will open the discussion reply editor. 
3. Click the link icon and paste the YouTube share link you copied in the URL space provided. 
4. Add an Alt text for inline preview to make this video link accessible to all students. 
5. Click Insert Link to embed this video in your reply post. 
6. Contextualize the video link so students know why you are sharing it and what to do with it. 
7. Click Post Reply.

### Scenario 2 - Share a file in an Announcement 

As you’re grading an assignment, you notice some students struggling with the same problem. Instead of uploading your excel sheet with the correct formulas and explanation individually you’d like to post the file in an announcement and address the whole class.

#### **How do you link to a file in your announcement text?**

1. Upload the excel sheet \(or any other file type\) to the appropriate folder in the Files from the course navigation. We recommend an organized, user-friendly Files area with named folders.
2. From the course navigation, click on Announcements and then click + Announcement to draft your message in the editor.
3. Within your announcement, describe the file you are sharing with students so they know that is being shared. I.e.; Please review the excel spreadsheet with the correct formulas to check your work. This text will be linked to the file.
4. Highlight the text to link, and then select the Files tab and click on excel file.
5. Click Save on your announcement to post in the course.

Note: You may also add a file as an attachment to an announcement but it is not as visible and connected to the announcement text.

{% tab title="Add an image to an Assignment" %}
### **Scenario 3 - Add an image to an Assignment**

The assignment students are being asked to do is connected to the information on the previous page. You have the perfect image file to bring this information to life and show what you are describing in text.

### How do you insert an image on an assignment page?

1. Make sure your image file is saved to your computer.
2. Like with the excel file, from the course navigation menu, click on Files to upload your image to the appropropriate folder.
3. Edit the assignment page and place your cursor where you’d like to insert the image file.
4. Select the Images tab on the right to find and select the image file. Once you click the image, it will appear in the assignment content editor.  
   ****a\) Resize the image if it is too big or too small. Click on the image to highlight it and then select the embed image icon from the rich content editor; the Insert/Edit Image box will pop up. Under Attributes, edit the dimensions to resize the image.

   b\) Add Alt text to make the image accessible to all students. Under Attributes, edit the Alt text. Alt text should be accurate and equivalent in presenting content and function of image, be succinct, not be redundant to other text information on the page, and not use phrases “image of” or “graphic of” to describe the image.

5. Once your image is where and how you want it to be, click Save on the assignment page.
