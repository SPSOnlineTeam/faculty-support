# Record a Screencast

A **screencast** is a digital recording of what a person does on their computer—the video version of a screenshot or picture of something on your computer's screen—which may also contain audio narration to accompany the video. 

**Panopto** is the media server at Brown. The steps below show you how to record a screencast with  Panopto, and upload it directly to your course's media library. 

### Recording a Screencast 

1. Click on **Media Library** from the left-hand course navigation.

If you have Panopto installed on your computer, the Panopto media recorder should open up. If you do not, you will be prompted to install the correct version for your operating system \(OS\) using your Brown credentials. After installing, open Panopto.![](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/fSj5lvmeOyBAj5h_ztC2U0sk1EaZ2FdTLnm7a6CCNs1dVT0Jt0ADhibYd0EkjWojJLQKWS3K72-vYBn9oYCI5s-3ipVXGiAYudaKBGvsHOr_FaRXvfZC5aMP4dPat5Bbws6OTBnS)
{% endhint %}

3. The Panopto media recorder window is simple. Make a few selections and you're ready to record your presentation.

* Prepare your microphone. Use a headset or earbud mic instead of the computer's built-in mic, if possible.
* Select your Secondary Source 1 and Now you can start recording!
* To finish recording the presentation, press the Esc key on your keyboard, and then click on the Stop button \(where the Record button was located earlier\)
