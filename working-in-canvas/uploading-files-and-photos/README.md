# Enhance Content with Files or URLs

You can share a number of file types, including .pdf, .xls, .doc, images \(.png, .jpg\), videos, and URL links in your course. Authentic materials enhance your content and help your students learn; the content comes alive when you show how it’s applied to the “real world”.

The following scenarios are common occurrences while designing or delivering an online course.

1. Add a Video URL
2. Share a File \(xls, pdf, doc, ppt, etc.\)
3. Embed an Image \(png, jpg, etc.\)

{% hint style="info" %}
NOTE: The processes for linking to websites, uploading, or sharing images, videos, or text-based files are the same for all Canvas items \(e.g. discussions,  pages, assignments, or announcements\).

### Adding a Video Link to Your Discussion Reply

It’s 5pm, you are sitting down with a cup of tea to review what’s happening in your online discussion. You came across an interview on YouTube today that will highlight an opposing view's perspective in the discussion and potentially take the discussion to a new level. 

**What's the best way to add the video URL to your discussion post?** 

1. Copy and paste the Share YouTube link. \(You will need it for \#3\)
2. From the discussion, click reply to the initial post or to a thread of posts. This will open the discussion reply editor.
3. Click the link icon and paste the YouTube share link you copied in the URL space provided.
   1. IMPORTANT: to share a URL, you’d follow the same process--click the link icon and paste the url in the space provided.
4. Add an Alt text for inline preview to make this video link accessible to all students.
5. Click Insert Link to embed this video in your reply post.
6. Contextualize the video link so students know why you are sharing it and what to do with it.
7. Click Post Reply.

### Share a File in an Announcement 

While grading an assignment, you observe students struggling with the same problem. You'd like to post the excel spreadsheet with solutions and explanations for the whole class to review. Posting an announcement seems like the easiest way to do this. 

### How do you link to a file in your announcement text?

1. Upload the excel sheet \(or any other file type\) to one of your folders in the Files area.   _**NOTE:  We recommend an organized, user-friendly Files area with named folders.**_![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ou83T0OQatmdciZIjdxJnQ9naqbxm9iBkcsdm2t_0gb2kmWaQAQD32_654O1Sq8GoesZ80n0wkMs0-kv4sJARN2kdpdez0lzC5PQDC3ZuZblV-2BU3ua3oHreCznrDAaSuog9mUD)_\*\*\*\*_
2. From the course navigation, click on Announcements and then click + Announcement to draft your message in the editor.
3. Within your announcement, describe the file you are sharing with students so they know that is being shared. I.e.; _Please review the excel spreadsheet with the correct formulas to check your work._ This text will be linked to the file.
4. Highlight the text to link, and then select the Files tab and click on excel file.

5. Click Save on your announcement to post in the course.

_**Note: You may also add a file as an attachment to an announcement but it less visible to the viewer because it appears below the announcement text.**_

4. Select the Images tab on the right to find and select the image file. Once you click the image, it will appear in the assignment content editor.

   1. Resize the image if it is too big or too small. 
      1. Click on the image to highlight it and then select the embed image icon from the rich content editor; the Insert/Edit Image box will pop up. Under Attributes, edit the dimensions to resize the image.
   2. Add Alt text to make the image accessible to all students.
