# Adding Files to Your Online Content

You can share a number of file types, including .pdf, .xls, .doc, .png, .jpg, .mov, and URLs in your content. 

We've highlighted 3 common practices for sharing files or web pages.

1. Add a Video URL
2. Link a File \(xls, pdf, doc, ppt, etc.\)
3. Embed an Image \(png, jpg, etc.\)

NOTE: Use the same process for linking to websites and uploading or sharing images, videos, or text files for all Canvas page types \(e.g. discussions, pages, assignments or announcements\). 

üö© To add files to online content, you must be actively editing the Canvas page.

### Link to a File in an Announcement 

1. After navigating to **Announcements** on the left-hand side of your course site, click **+ Announcement** to draft your message. 
   * The announcement message should specifically mention the file you are sharing so students know what it is. \(e.g.; "_Please review the excel spreadsheet with the correct formulas to check your work._"\). __
2. Highlight the **text to link**, and then select the **Files** tab and click on your excel file.

3. Click **Save** on your announcement to post in the course.

TIP: You may also add a file as an attachment to an announcement but it is less visible to the viewer because it appears below the announcement text.

### Embed an Image in an Assignment

3. Select the **Images** tab on the right to find and select the image file. Once you click the image, it will appear in the assignment content editor.

* Resize the image if it is too big or too small. 
  * Click on the image to highlight it and then select the embed image icon from the rich content editor; the Insert/Edit Image box will pop up. Under Attributes, edit the dimensions to resize the image.
* Add Alt text to make the image accessible for learners using assistive technology. 
  * Under Attributes, edit the Alt text. Alt text is a succinct description that is equivalent to the function of the image. Do not use phrases like ‚Äúimage of‚Äù or ‚Äúgraphic of‚Äù to describe the image.

4. Click **Save** on the assignment page.
