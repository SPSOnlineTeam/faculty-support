# Adding Files to Your Online Content

You can share a number of file types, including .pdf, .xls, .doc, images \(.png, .jpg\), videos, and URLs in your content. 

We've highlighted 3 common practices for sharing files or web pages.

1. Add a Video URL
2. Link a File \(xls, pdf, doc, ppt, etc.\)
3. Embed an Image \(png, jpg, etc.\)

{% hint style="warning" %}
The processes for linking to websites, uploading, or sharing images, videos, or text-based files are the same for all Canvas items \(e.g. discussions,  pages, assignments or announcements\).

### Link to a File in an Announcement 

1. Click on the **Announcements** button on the left-hand side of your course site, and then click **+ Announcement** to draft your message. 
   * Your announcement message should describe the file you are sharing so students know what it is; \(e.g. "Please review the excel spreadsheet with the correct formulas to check your work."\). __
2. Highlight the **text to link**, and then select the **Files** tab and click on your excel file.

### Embed an Image in an Assignment

1. Download the image file to your computer. 
2. Edit the assignment page and place your cursor where you’d like to insert the image file.![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6YhTvrXCbrb173OKM-v0_1UC8aCEvgkxahiQbYmLrShZ1T9puRmPLJ5MNYzgqSYlcENSJWscJYGd8XHWKiuIz_r7tLhWfgVaNgr-tOOXj0C2ciUzcy0O3FwQdPZjTUfKn01CAArT)
3. Select the **Images** tab on the right to find and select the image file. Once you click the image, it will appear in the assignment content editor.

   * Resize the image if it is too big or too small. 
     * Click on the image to highlight it and then select the embed image icon from the rich content editor; the Insert/Edit Image box will pop up. Under Attributes, edit the dimensions to resize the image.
   * Add Alt text to make the image accessible. 
     * Under Attributes, edit the Alt text. Alt text is a succinct description that is equivalent to the function of the image. Do not use phrases like “image of” or “graphic of” to describe the image.
