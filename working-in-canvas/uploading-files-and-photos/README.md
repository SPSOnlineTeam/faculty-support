# Add Files to Your Online Content

You can share a number of file types, including .pdf, .xls, .doc, images \(.png, .jpg\), videos, and URLs in your content. 

We've highlighted 3 common practices for sharing files or web pages.

1. Add a Video URL
2. Link a File \(xls, pdf, doc, ppt, etc.\)
3. Embed an Image \(png, jpg, etc.\)

### Link to a File in an Announcement 

**How do you link to an Excel file in your announcement text?**

1. Upload the excel sheet \(or any other file type\) to one of your folders in the Files area.  _NOTE: We recommend an organized, user-friendly Files area with named folders._ ![](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/ou83T0OQatmdciZIjdxJnQ9naqbxm9iBkcsdm2t_0gb2kmWaQAQD32_654O1Sq8GoesZ80n0wkMs0-kv4sJARN2kdpdez0lzC5PQDC3ZuZblV-2BU3ua3oHreCznrDAaSuog9mUD) 
2. From the course navigation, click on Announcements and then click + Announcement to draft your message in the editor.
3. Within your announcement, describe the file you are sharing with students so they know that is being shared \(e.g. "Please review the excel spreadsheet with the correct formulas to check your work."\) __This text will be linked to the file.
4. Highlight the text to link, and then select the Files tab and click on excel file.

4. Select the Images tab on the right to find and select the image file. Once you click the image, it will appear in the assignment content editor.

   * Resize the image if it is too big or too small. 
     * Click on the image to highlight it and then select the embed image icon from the rich content editor; the Insert/Edit Image box will pop up. Under Attributes, edit the dimensions to resize the image.
   * Add Alt text to make the image accessible to all students. 
     * Under Attributes, edit the Alt text. Alt text should be accurate and equivalent in presenting content and function of image, be succinct, not be redundant to other text information on the page, and not use phrases “image of” or “graphic of” to describe the image.
