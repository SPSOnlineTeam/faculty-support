# Finding Your Course

Looking for your course, but can’t find it on the Canvas dashboard? Or would you like to remove courses from the dashboard? Then read on for how to do so.

Referencing the example below, let’s imagine you would like to see the courses “Christine’s Sandbox,” “EMSL2000: Effective Leadership,” and “EMSL2010: Persuasive Communication” on the Canvas dashboard.  Right now, as you can see, that is not the case.

To make those courses to appear on the dashboard, you must select, on the left-hand menu, “Courses,” and then click on “All Courses.”
