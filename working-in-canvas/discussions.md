# Discussions

### What are Canvas Discussions

Online discussions provide an opportunity for thoughtful contributions and engage all students in the class not just a confident and uninhibited few, as might be the case in a face-to-face class. Discussion pages present a prompt for students to respond to, with background context as needed \(text, audio, video, images, links\). Students can respond to the prompt and to each others’ responses.  


### Creating a Discussion

Discussion pages are edited just like content \(wiki\) pages in Canvas\[link\], with additional assignment settings, such as points and due date. Common configuration options include,

* “Allow threaded replies”: Necessary for students to reply to each other.
* “Users must post before seeing replies”: This makes for less of a conversation and more of a public posting of responses.
* “Allow liking”: Less demanding alternative to replying to posts.
* Availability: Window of time when students can participate.
* Allowing students to attach files to posts is a course-level option \(in course Settings\).
