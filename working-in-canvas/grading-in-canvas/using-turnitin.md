# Using Turnitin

**What it is**

Turnitin is tool that compares student papers with a vast array of online sources and repositories and returns a detailed report on similarities. This similarity report _may_ reveal evidence of plagiarism in a student's work, but the report needs to be carefully reviewed by the instructor before such a determination can be made. This page addresses that effort. 

At Brown, Turnitin can only be used within Canvas, by submitting papers through assignments. The Turnitin website cannot be used directly for generating reports.

**How to use it \(instructors/TAs\)** 

To view the report on a student's submitted paper, follow the instructions below.

1. Go to the assignment page and click on the **SpeedGrader** button, on the right: ![Turnitin-Speed Grader button.png](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1073413/files/60999659/preview)   
2.  In the right pane of SpeedGrader, next to the file name of the student's uploaded paper, there's a percentage in a colored box. Low scores are in green , middle in  yellow, high in red. Click on this number to access the report.  \(Note: Students access the report through **Grades**.\) ![Turnitin-Speedgrader panel.png](https://canvas.brown.edu/courses/1073413/files/60999660/preview)
