# Grading in Canvas

## **Finding and Viewing Students’ Work**

### Canvas has three views of grades: 

1. 'Quick Grading' on the Grades tab

   a. What the colors and common symbols mean

   b. How to change column view   
   c. How to mute and unmute assignment columns

2. 'Assignments' view 
3. SpeedGrader!

{% hint style="info" %}
**Speedgrader** offers an easy way for you to review student assignment and discussion submissions. Through the tool, you can provide feedback to your students using text, audio or video, and it even lets you write your feedback directly on the documents they’ve submitted.
{% endhint %}

### **Navigating Submissions in Speedgrader**

1. A pulldown menu lets you see all students, and which ones have submitted work.
2. View may vary based on whether you’re looking at a discussion, a document or a text submission.
3. Muting assignments will allow you to complete your grading without students being able to see them until you’re done. Unmute to share them with all students simultaneously.

#### Giving Students Feedback: 

1. Assignment Comments

   a. Generates** **notifications to students

   b. Notice the audio/video file upload options  
   c. Students can reply to you! \(where do faculty see these?\)  

2. Filling in a grade

   a. Type in a grade  \(letter, number, complete/incomplete is set in the Assignment\)

   b. Comment and Grade. \(You can accidentally comment without grading!\)  

3. Annotating a document directly

   a. Very cool functionality

   b. But - No notifications are sent! You may want to add a line such as ‘see my annotations’ in assignment comments comment form as well.
