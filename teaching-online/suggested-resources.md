### Key findings

* Students in online conditions performed modestly better, on average, than those learning the same material through traditional face-to-face instruction.
* Instruction combining online and face-to-face elements \(blended learning\) produced better learning outcome results than either purely face-to-face or purely online instruction.  
* Online learning can be enhanced by giving learners control of their interactions with media and prompting learner reflection.
