# Primary Responsibilities

The following practices are designed to ensure that your students: 

* feel your presence and involvement in teaching the course;
* can get help promptly when they need it; 
* and, know what is expected and where they stand in the course. 

As valued faculty in Brown's online programs, we encourage you to employ many of the practices described below. As guidelines, some of these can be bent, but none should be disregarded. 

## Be Visible in Your Course

### Introduce Yourself  

Introduce yourself at the start of your course with an announcement welcoming students and letting them know who you are. 

### Sum Up Weekly

Send our a weekly announcement that summarizes the work students have just completed and prepares students for the week ahead or what's coming next. This makes the space feel more like a classroom and helps everyone be focused in the same direction.

### Establish Teacher Presence

Establish teaching presence in your online course by logging in often in order to effectively facilitate the course, and:

* monitor student progress \(are they completing assignments on time?\); 
* assess student work and provide meaningful feedback; 
* participate actively in course discussions \(e.g., commenting on student posts, responding to student questions, and/or encouraging further interaction\);
* plan to log in and visit the course at least five days per week during the run of your online modules to facilitate the course. 

### Grade Promptly

Grade assignments and/or provide detailed feedback promptly so students know how they are doing – ideally before your next assignment is due. 

#### Suggested Idea: Offer Office Hours or Live Help Session

Post "office hours" instructions so that students may request an appointment. Planned in advance, these can help connect students with each other and with you. Our instructional designers can assist with setting up logistics for these with an online conference tool like Zoom \(provided by Brown and free for you to use\).

## Brown's Commitment to Students

Brown University promises its students a rigorous, inclusive, and respectful academic experience, regardless of whether a course is offered online or in the classroom. Brown’s faculty are committed to the highest quality teaching and learning.

Remember, unlike in a face-to-face classroom, these students don’t see your body language or hear your extemporaneous comments; and you don’t get to see their expressions of \(in\)comprehension at key moments, or their raised hands. There is only the interaction that happens through the learning management system \(LMS\), email, and other course tools; so effective use of these tools to collapse distance and promote presence becomes crucial.
