# Online Teaching Resources for Faculty

#### **Welcome to the School of Professional Studies Online Teaching Resources for Faculty!** 

Research shows that quality online teaching calls for: 

1. A **robust faculty presence**: your engagement with students
2. Mastery of the teaching and learning **platform**: working confidently in Canvas/Campus
3. Effective **teaching** methods: thoughtful student-centered design with the end goal in mind

The SPS Instructional Designers \(IDs\) have created the resources on this site specifically for Brown faculty, instructors, and TAs to make designing and facilitating their online course an enriching teaching and learning experience.
