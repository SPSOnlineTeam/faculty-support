# How to Change a Thread to “Read Only”

If you want to change a thread to “read only,” then you must lock it. Locking a thread prohibits students from adding to the thread or editing previous comments.

#### Where should you lock a thread?

Lock a thread when you’re ready to move the forum session forward \(i.e.; from one day to the next\) and/or provide feedback and close the session when you do not want students to be able to alter posts.

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note: Make sure threads have been open long enough to enable student participation and that enough threads are open at any one time to allow students to meaningfully add to the conversation. For example, you could stagger the opening and closing of threads, or ensure that threads are kept open for 36-48 hours before closing them. See the image below for how to lock a thread.
{% endhint %}
