Before you “unhide” assignment or participation grades, use the Grading Sheet “calculator” to check the grade average \(3.32 or below\). 

1. Assign students' scores in the Grade Center. 

2. Get the letter grade from the weighted column in Grade Center

3. Use your grading sheet “calculator”: type the letter grade in the Final Grade column. 

4. If you have grade inflation, you may adjust your grade distribution or threshold to achieve the 3.32 average or below.
