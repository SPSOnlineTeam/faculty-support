# How to Respond to Threads

### Respond to, or comment on, individual student posts

To reply to a post, access a forum and select a thread. 

* On the thread’s page, you can view the text of the post and information, such as the author and posted date. 

Identify the student post you’d like to respond to. 

* You’ll see options: **Reply**, **Quote**, **Mark as Read**. 

Click on **Reply** to respond to a post.

#### Address the whole class within a thread to redirect the conversation or add to it. Alternatively, you may create a new thread and close the old thread.

TIP: If you’d like your comment to appear in a thread but not as a response to a post, click **Reply** to the initial thread prompt \(usually yours, if you created the thread\).
{% endhint %}

### Tips for Responding to Threads

A thoughtful response or question can advance a discussion. Here are some best practices for responding to threads:

* Mention students by name. The simple act of mentioning a student’s name can elicit a substantial response in return.
* Quote something the student said in their post and then ask them to take the point further.
* Respond to a particular post and then invite other students to respond in turn.
* Add new energy to a thread by sharing a new resource or asking students to make connections or predictions.
